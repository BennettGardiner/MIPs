# A script to solve the tables and chairs problem using Linear Programming.

# The problem is as follows - there is a grid of (originally) 8 rows and 18 columns,
# each cell can contain a maximum of one object:
#       - a table
#       - a chair
#       - a bin
# There are bins in the two middle cells in the last row. Chairs must be next to
# at least one table, and tables cannot touch, even diagonally. Maximise the number
# of chairs.
